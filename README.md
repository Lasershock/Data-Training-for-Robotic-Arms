# Failure Detection in Robotic Arms using Machine Learning  

This project focuses on building a machine-learning system capable of detecting failures in robotic arms using multivariate sensor data. The work includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model benchmarking, and evaluation across several ML algorithms.

Models explored include:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost (multi-class)  

The goal of the project is to determine which model best identifies early-stage failures based on patterns in the robot's sensor readings.


## Project Overview

### Key Objectives
- Build an end-to-end ML pipeline for robotic arm failure classification.

- Use confusion matrices, classification reports, and probability outputs to evaluate performance.  

### Data Preprocessing Steps
- Label encoding  
- Normalization / scaling  
- Feature engineering  

### Hyperparameter Tuning Techniques
- Grid Search  
- Random Search
